# F5 TTS for Swift

Implementation of [F5-TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06885) in Swift, using the [MLX Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift) framework.

You can listen to a [sample here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lucasnewman.datasets/f5tts/sample.wav) that was generated in ~11 seconds on an M3 Max MacBook Pro.

See the [Python repository](https://github.com/lucasnewman/f5-tts-mlx) for additional details on the model architecture.

This repository is based on the original [Pytorch implementation of F5-TTS](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS).

## Installation

The `F5TTS` Swift package can be built and run from Xcode or SwiftPM.

A pretrained model is available [on Huggingface](https://hf.co/lucasnewman/f5-tts-mlx).

## Usage

```swift
import F5TTS

let f5tts = try await F5TTS.fromPretrained(repoId: "lucasnewman/f5-tts-mlx")

// Or, with a custom model name:
// let f5tts = try await F5TTS.fromPretrained(repoId: "lucasnewman/f5-tts-mlx", modelName: "model_v1.safetensors")

let generatedAudio = try await f5tts.generate(text: "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.")
```

The result is an MLXArray with 24kHz audio samples.

If you want to use your own reference audio sample, make sure it's a mono, 24kHz wav file of around 5-10 seconds:

```swift
let generatedAudio = try await f5tts.generate(
    text: "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.",
    referenceAudioURL: ...,
    referenceAudioText: "This is the caption for the reference audio."
)
```

You can convert an audio file to the correct format with ffmpeg like this:

```bash
ffmpeg -i /path/to/audio.wav -ac 1 -ar 24000 -sample_fmt s16 -t 10 /path/to/output_audio.wav
```
